              <br/>
                <p>Quickposes is an app to help artists train their drawing skills by simulating a real world academic life drawing sessions.</p>
                <p>Select your pose duration and a bunch of pose galleries and you are ready to go!</p>

The purpose of this exercise is about trying to find the essence of the pose within the time constraint of the pose duration. Each time the pose duration expired, a new random pose is presented so you can try again. At the end of the session, a summary is displayed, use it to see how good you did this time.</p>
                <p>This exercise is called gesture drawing and it is great to develop your skills at observing, simplifying and it is also good for warming you up before any long drawing sessions.</p>
