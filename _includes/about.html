              <br/>
                <p>Quickposes is an app to help artists train their drawing skills by simulating a real world academic life drawing sessions.</p>
                <p>You begin by setting up your drawing session with parameters like pose duration, warmup delay between poses, activate Apple pencil drawing mode and you select a few images galleries (that you can upload using iTunes file sharing).</p>
                <p>Once done, you can start the real drawing session. From there, the app will display each pose randomly selected for the given duration and let you draw along wether directly in the app or by using your favorite drawing app (via app multitasking) or traditionally using pen and paper.</p>
                <p>Once finished, you'll get a summary of all the poses you train with and you can start over with same or new parameters and photos.</p>
