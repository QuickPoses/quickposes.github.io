This exercise is the first one recommended by the [Love Life Drawing website in its series for beginners][1].
It consists in taking a series of images and tracing over them the movement of the pose in 4 to 5 bold strokes maximum.

To replicate this exercice on Quick Poses, applied the configuration shown on the left: 

- **Direct drawing with overlay option** to be able to draw over the image
- **Infinite duration** so you can take your time finding the right strokes

For the brush, I recommend **a bold marker** to make big strokes and avoid the temptation to make too much of them (see below).

Once you are comfortable with this exercise, you can increase the difficulty by adding a time limit.
