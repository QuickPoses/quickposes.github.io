title: Use multitasking to practice in your favorite drawing app
description: |

- Disable drawing mode to practice outside the app like with pen and paper for example. 
- And use iPad multitasking feature to run the app side by side with your favorite drawing app (eg. Procreate™, Paper™, Tayasui™, Photoshop™, etc.).
